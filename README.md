This is my first time to create vue project, 
I watched tutorial of the net ninja for vue fundamentals, 
Traversy media for vuex crash course,
The net ninja for vue composition API

Do not compare yourself to others you might be slow in learning 
But small is still a progress.. keep it up and learn more...
